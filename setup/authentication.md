# Authentication

Out of the box, StackState is configured with [file-based authentication](authentication.md#configuring-file-based-authentication), which authenticates users against a file on the server. In addition to this mode, StackState can also authenticate users against the following authentication servers:

* [LDAP](authentication.md#ldap-authentication-server)
* [KeyCloak OIDC](authentication.md#ckeycloak-oidc-authentication-server)

{% hint style="info" %}
Authentication configuration is stored in the file `etc/application_stackstate.conf` in the StackState installation directory. Restart StackState for any changes made to this file to take effect.
{% endhint %}

## User roles

StackState ships with the default user roles **Guest**, **Power User** and **Administrator**:

* **Guest** - able to see information but make no changes.
* **Power User** - able to see and change all configuration and install StackPacks.
* **Administrator** - able to see and change all configuration, install StackPacks, grant and revoke user permissions and upload \(new versions of\) StackPacks.

When deciding on the roles to assign your users it is strongly advised to have only a small group of Administrators, for example only the engineers responsible for installing StackState and doing the initial configuration. Administrator users can manage access to StackState and decide which StackPacks can be used. Installing StackPacks and other fine tuning of the configuration can be delegated to a larger number of users with the Power User role.

It is also possible to add more roles, see the page [Roles \(RBAC\)](../configure/security/rbac/rbac_roles.md) and the other [RBAC documentation pages](https://github.com/StackVista/stackstate-docs/tree/51daef01199490a90b81f339d205a46b1c4302f3/configure/security/rbac/README.md)

## Default username and password

StackState is configured by default with the following administrator account:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Kubernetes" %}
* **username:** `admin`
* **password:** Set during installation. This is collected by the `generate_values.sh` script and stored in MD5 hash format in `values.yaml`
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux" %}
* **username:** `admin`
* **password:** `topology-telemetry-time`
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## File-based authentication

To keep using configuration file based authentication but change the users, here is an example to have 2 users, `admin-demo` and `guest-demo`, with the default roles Administrator and Guest.

```javascript
authentication {
  enabled  = true

  basicAuth = false

  # Amount of time to keep a session when a user does not log in
  sessionLifetime = 7d

  authServer {
    authServerType = "stackstateAuthServer"

    stackstateAuthServer {
      # echo -n "password" | md5sum
      # Set the MD5 Hash into `auth.password`
      logins = [
        { username = "admin-demo", password: "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99", roles = ["admin-demo-role"] }
        { username = "guest-demo", password: "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99", roles = ["guest-demo-role"] }
      ]
    }
  }
  adminGroups = ["stackstate-admin", "admin-demo-role"]
  powerUserGroups = ["stackstate-power-user"]
  guestGroups = ["stackstate-guest", "guest-demo-role"]
}
```

Configuration field explanation:

1. **sessionLifeTime** - when users log into StackState, they start a session with StackState during which they can access the system. This setting controls the duration of those sessions.
2. **authServer** - configures the authentication server StackState uses. It's configuration is specified below.
3. **password** - the user's password in MD5 hash format.
4. **roles** - the list of roles the user is a member of.
5. **adminGroups** - the list of roles that receive Administrator privileges.
6. **powerUserGroups** - the list of roles that receive Power User privileges.
7. **guestGroups** - the list of roles that have Guest access privileges \(read-only\) in StackState.

## LDAP authentication server

Here is an example of an authentication configuration that uses a localhost LDAP server. Place it within the `stackstate { api {` block of the `etc/application_stackstate.conf`. Make sure to change the line `authentication.enabled = false` to `authentication.enabled = true` in the `application_stackstate.conf` file. Restart StackState to make the change take effect.

```javascript
authentication {
  enabled  = true

  basicAuth = false

  # Amount of time to keep a session when a user does not log in
  sessionLifetime = 7d

  authServer {
    authServerType = "ldapAuthServer"

    ldapAuthServer {
      connection {
        host = localhost
        port = 8000
        # ssl {
        #    sslType = ssl
        #    trustCertificatesPath = "/var/lib/ssl/sts-ldap.pem"
        #    trustStorePath = "/var/lib/ssl/cacerts"
        # }
        bindCredentials {
           dn = "cn=Ldap bind user,ou=management,o=stackstate,cn=people,dc=example,dc=com"
           password = "password"
         }
      }
      userQuery {
        parameters = [
          { ou : management }
          { o : stackstate }
          { cn: people }
          { dc : example }
          { dc : com }
        ]
        usernameKey = cn
      }
      groupQuery {
        parameters = [
          { ou : groups }
          { o : stackstate }
          { cn: people }
          { dc : example }
          { dc : com }
        ]
        rolesKey = cn
        groupMemberKey = member
      }
    }
  }
  guestGroups = ["stackstate-guest"]
  powerUserGroups = ["stackstate-power-user"]
  adminGroups = ["stackstate-admin"]
}
```

Configuration field explanation:

1. **sessionLifeTime** - when users log into StackState, they start a session with StackState during which they can access the system. This setting controls the duration of those sessions.
2. **authServer** - configures the authentication server StackState uses. It's configuration is specified below.
3. **ldapAuthServer** - LDAP configuration requires information about connecting to the LDAP server and how to query the server for users.
   * _**query, userQuery and groupQuery**_ - The set of parameters inside correspond to the base dn of your LDAP for where users and groups can be found. The first one is used for authenticating users in StackState, while the second is used for retrieving the group of that user to determine if the user is an Administrator, Power User or a Guest.
   * _**sslType**_ - the type of LDAP secure connection `ssl` \| `startTls`
   * _**trustCertificatesPath**_ - optional, path to the trust store on the StackState server. Formats PEM, DER and PKCS7 are supported.
   * _**trustStorePath**_ - optional, path to the trust store on the StackState server.
   * \(if both `trustCertificatesPath` and `trustStorePath` are specified, `trustCertificatesPath` takes precedence\)
   * _**bindCredentials**_ - optional, used to authenticate StackState to LDAP server if the LDAP server does not support anonymous LDAP searches.
   * _**usernameKey**_ - the name of the attribute that stores the username, value is matched against the username provided on the login screen.
   * _**groupMemberKey**_ - the name of the attribute that indicates whether a user is a member of a group. The constructed LDAP filter follows this pattern: `({groupMemberKey}=email=admin@sts.com,ou=management,o=stackstate,cn=people,dc=example,dc=com)`.
   * _**rolesKey**_ - the name of the attribute that stores the group name.
4. **adminGroups** - the list of roles that receive Administrator privileges.
5. **powerUserGroups** - the list of roles that receive Power User privileges.
6. **guestGroups** - the list of roles that have Guest access privileges \(read-only\) in StackState.

Please note that StackState can check for user files in LDAP main directory as well as in all subdirectories. To do that StackState LDAP configuration requires `bind credentials` configured. Bind credentials are used to authenticate StackState to LDAP server, only after that StackState passes the top LDAP directory name for the user that wants to login to StackState.

After editing the config file with the required LDAP details, move on to the [subject configuration doc](../configure/security/rbac/rbac_subjects.md). With subjects created, you can start [setting up roles](../configure/security/rbac/rbac_roles.md).

### Kubernetes LDAP configuration through Helm

When using LDAP with Kubernetes, a number of \(secret\) values can be passed through the Helm values. You can provide the following values to configure LDAP:

* `stackstate.authentication.ldap.bind.dn`: The bind DN to use to authenticate to LDAP
* `stackstate.authentication.ldap.bind.password`: The bind password to use to authenticate to LDAP
* `stackstate.authentication.ldap.ssl.type`: The SSL Connection type to use to connect to LDAP \(Either ssl or starttls\)
* `stackstate.authentication.ldap.ssl.trustStore`: The Certificate Truststore to verify server certificates against
* `stackstate.authentication.ldap.ssl.trustCertificates`: The client Certificate trusted by the server

The `trustStore` and `trustCertificates` values need to be set from the command line, as they typically contain binary data. A sample command for this looks like:

```text
helm install \
--set-file stackstate.authentication.ldap.ssl.trustStore=./ldap-cacerts \
--set-file stackstate.authentication.ldap.ssl.trustCertificates=./ldap-certificate.pem \
... \
stackstate/stackstate
```

For more details of configuration through Helm, see the [StackState Helm chart readme](https://github.com/StackVista/helm-charts/blob/master/stable/stackstate/README.md).

## KeyCloak OIDC Authentication Server

In order to configure StackState to authenticate to an KeyCloak OIDC authentication server, you will need to configure both of them to be able to talk to each other. The following sections describe the respective setups.

### Configuring StackState to authenticate against a KeyCloak OIDC Authentication Server

Here is an example of an authentication configuration that uses a running KeyCloak server. Place it within the `stackstate { api {` block of the `etc/application_stackstate.conf`. Make sure to change the line `authentication.enabled = false` to `authentication.enabled = true` in the `application_stackstate.conf` file. Restart StackState to make the change take effect.

```javascript
authentication {
  enabled  = true

  basicAuth = false

  authServer {
    authServerType = "keycloakAuthServer"

    keycloakAuthServer {
      clientId = stackstate
      secret = 8051a2e4-e367-4631-a0f5-98fc9cdc564d
      keycloakBaseUri = "http://keycloak.acme.com:8011/auth"
      realm = acme
      redirectUri = "http://stackstate.acme.com:7070/loginCallback"
      authenticationMethod = "client_secret_basic"
      jwsAlgorithm = "RS256"
    }
  }
  guestGroups = ["stackstate-guest"]
  powerUserGroups = ["stackstate-power-user"]
  adminGroups = ["stackstate-admin"]
}
```

Configuration field explanation:

1. **clientId** - The ID of the KeyCloak client as configured in KeyCloak
2. **secret** - The secret attached to the KeyCloak client, which is used to authenticate this client to KeyCloak
3. **keycloakBaseUri** - The base URI for the KeyCloak instance
4. **realm** - The KeyCloak realm to connect to
5. **redirectUri** - The URI where the login callback endpoint of StackState is reachable
6. **authenticationMethod** - Set this to `client_secret_basic` which is the only supported value for now
7. **jwsAlgorithm** - Set this to `RS256`, which is the only supported value for now

The KeyCloak specific values can be obtained from the client configuration in KeyCloak.

### Configuring a KeyCloak client for use with StackState

In order to connect StackState to KeyCloak, you need to add a new client configuration to the KeyCloak Authentication Server. The necessary settings for the client are:

1. **Client ID** - This is the ID of the client that is connecting, we recommend naming this `stackstate`
2. **Client Protocol** - Set this to `openid-connect`
3. **Access Type** - Set this to `confidential`, so that a secret is used to establish the connection between KeyCloak and StackState
4. **Standard Flow Enabled** - This should be `Enabled`
5. **Implicit Flow Enabled** - This should be `Disabled`
6. **Root URL** - This should point to the root location of StackState
7. **Valid redirect URIs** - This shoud be `/loginCallback/*`
8. **Base URL** - This should point to the root location of StackState

## REST API authentication

If you use StackState's REST API directly \(as opposed to via the GUI\) you can also enable authentication. The REST API supports basic authentication for authenticating users against the configured authentication mechanism.

**basicAuth** - turn basic authentication on/off for the StackState REST API. Turn this setting on if you use the StackState REST API from external scripts that cannot use the HTML form-based login.

```javascript
authentication {
      enabled  = true

      basicAuth = false

      ...


    }
```
