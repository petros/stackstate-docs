# SCOM

## What is the SCOM StackPack?

The SCOM StackPack is used to create a near real time synchronisation with your SCOM instance.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites need to be met:

* [StackState Agent V2](agent.md)  must be installed on a single machine which can connect to SCOM and StackState.
* A SCOM instance must be running.

**NOTE**:- We support SCOM version 1806 and 2019.

## Enable SCOM integration

To enable the SCOM check and begin collecting data from your SCOM instance:

1. Edit the Agent integration configuration file `/etc/stackstate-agent/conf.d/scom.d/conf.yaml` to include details of your SCOM instance:
   * **hostip** - SCOM IP.
   * **domain** - active directory domain where the SCOM is located.
   * **auth\_mode** - Network or Windows \(Default is Network\).
   * **username** 
   * **password** - use [secrets management](../../configure/security/secrets_management.md) to store passwords outside of the configuration file.

     ```text
     # Section used for global SCOM check config
     init_config:
       # run every minute
       min_collection_interval: 60

     instances:
     - hostip: #SCOM IP
       domain: # active directory domain where the SCOM is located
       username: # username
       password: # password
       auth_mode: Network # Network or Windows (Default is Network)
       streams:
         #- name: SCOM
         #  class: Microsoft.SystemCenter.ManagementGroup  --> Management Pack root class
         #- name: Exchange
         #  class: Microsoft.Exchange.15.Organization
         #- name: Skype
         #  class: Microsoft.LS.2015.Site
     ```
2. [Restart the StackState Agent\(s\)](agent.md#start-stop-restart-the-stackstate-agent) to publish the configuration changes.
3. Once the Agent is restarted, wait for the Agent to collect the data and send it to StackState.
