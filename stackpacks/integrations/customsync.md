# Custom Synchronization

## What is the Custom Synchronization StackPack?

The Custom Synchronization StackPack contains everything you need to automatically synchronize topology information from an external topology source.

**NOTE**: _Custom Synchronization_ StackPack is available from StackState version _1.14.4_ and higher.

**Use the Custom Synchronization StackPack if you want to connect an external topology source that is not listed as a standard StackPack.**
